# 🌀 OpenFasciaBalance

An open-source scoliosis recovery visualization tool inspired by Dr. Yan HsiaoHua’s “大脑学习法” (Brain Learning Method).  
Built with love and purpose — to help people understand fascia, muscle imbalance, and neuro-body rebalancing for scoliosis and posture correction.

---

## 🌟 Mission

To provide a free and easy-to-use anatomy and fascia visualization platform  
that integrates physical therapy knowledge, fascial chains, and scoliosis-informed recovery strategies.

---

## 🛠️ Key Features (Planned)

- ✅ SVG-based full-body muscle anatomy map
- ✅ Toggleable fascia lines (e.g., spiral line, superficial back line)
- ✅ Interactive UI with muscle hover + info panel
- ✅ JSON data layer for muscle + fascia metadata
- ✅ Markdown-based recovery notes that I wrote while practicing 大脑学习法 since 2025.01
- ✅ API endpoints (planned) for external integration (e.g., blog, clinics)
- ✅ GitHub Pages deployment and community collaboration
